                                 Working with a DevOps CI/CD Pipeline in AWS
Problem Statement:
In this assignment we will create a Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery pipeline using AWS, and then use that pipeline to deploy a new version of our website automatically. We'll implement this with AWS CodeStar, a frontend tool that will automatically configure AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeBuild, AWS CodeDeploy, and AWS CodePipeline. By the end of the lab, you should understand what a CI/CD pipeline is, as well as the basics of how to set one up and push an update to a source code repository to trigger a new deploy.

Solution
Create a CI/CD Pipeline using codestar service using html type project
Deploy a New Version of a Website using a CI/CD Pipeline by using codestar repository(however you can use any repository of your choice if you have the required details in your repository)
Test your pipeline with defaults html script
Edit your html script and re run your pipeline to test it again and confirm that your application is successfully deployed using CI/CD and the html updates that you would have made  changes  earlier is available in the application
